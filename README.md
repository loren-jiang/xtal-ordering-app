# xtal-order-ap
A quick webapp written with Google Apps Script to replace old Quartzy system. The idea is to maintain a working, accurate inventory of crystal screens and lab supplies in stock for purchasing.

The app connects to a Google sheet that acts a database for inventory and purchases.

Users receive email confirmation upon ordering.
